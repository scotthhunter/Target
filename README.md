# Target

This is my project for Target's first HBCU Hackaton where this project was finalist. 
The challenge was to build a solution to help Target find new store locations.

My solution involves assigning locations a score based on the 
the goals of the team. The application pull mock populaton data and security data to help generate a score. The score could be used to compare possible locations.
